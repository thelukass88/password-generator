## Description
Using what I have learned recently in Javascript, I have used a series of variables and functions to generate a random password. The password characters will be selected by the user, based on a series of prompts, and will draw from one or more of a series of arrays which contain the chosen characters.

## Comments

This is my second submission of this project. 
Intially, I had struggled to validate the inputs from the confirm prompts. 
I had to work on my understanding of how to use functions to influence elements outside of themselves. 

## Tests
